# LicencsePlateRecognition

This study examines different image processing techniques to improve the accuracy of License Plate Recognition (LPR). Our goal was to find the best method for making license plates clearer and easier to detect. We applied techniques like smoothing (using Averaging and Gaussian Filters), sharpening, edge detection (Sobel and Canny Operators), and contrast enhancement (histogram equalization) to see which gave the best results. For license plate detection, we used a pre-trained model from Roboflow's License Plate Recognition Computer Vision Project, and for reading the characters, we used easyOCR. To measure the effectiveness of each method, we compared the confidence levels of the recognized characters. The histogram equalized images stood out, achieving the highest confidence level of 81%, surpassing all other methods in performance.
